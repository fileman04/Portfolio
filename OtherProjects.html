                        One of the biggest struggles for me in this project was the wrapping colours, our program had to loop between 6 colours, even if we wanted more than 6 insults printed. I overcame this small obstacle and got 100 on this project.

                        About 2 years ago i purchased a mini pc and ran a small minecraft server for me and my friends. It was very successful and since then I have upgraded both the machine running the server as well as the software that hosts it. The latest update to my server is called geyser, a program that allows bedrock (console & mobile users) to join and play on the same world as java players.

                        <h4>Minecraft Railgun - Personal redstone Project</h4>

                        This is a bit of a strange one, but bear with me. redstone is basically the electrical wiring of minecraft, and when you get REALLY into it you can do crazy things. This particular project has been a goal of mine, because in minecraft, an arrow does more damage the faster it goes. So if we can accelerate an arrow with enough momentumn we can make a weapon that can one-shot anything. I recently had some major progress in this project, fixing my slight alignment issues, now the arrow flies perfectly straight.
